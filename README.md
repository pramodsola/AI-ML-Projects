# AI-ML-Projects
This repository is used to capture the articles and code related to the AI &amp; ML projects
This repository contains a collection of AI/ML projects that Iâ€™ve been working on as part of my learning journey and professional development in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Engineering.

The projects are focused on solving real-world problems using modern ML techniques and cover the complete workflow â€” from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and deployment.

ðŸ”¹ Key Highlights

Supervised Learning: Classification & Regression tasks using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.

Deep Learning: Hands-on with Neural Networks, Activation Functions, Dropout, Backpropagation, and Optimization techniques.

Evaluation Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1/F2 Score, Binary Cross Entropy, ROC-AUC, and Regression metrics (RMSE, MAE).

Feature Engineering: Handling categorical encoding, missing values, outliers, and scaling.

Ensemble Learning: Bagging vs Boosting, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, XGBoost.

Data Engineering Integration: Using Spark, Databricks, ADF, and Python for scalable data pipelines.

Capstone Projects:

Visa Approval Prediction (EasyVisa) â€“ Classification project to predict visa approvals using ML models.

Pregnancy Diabetes Prediction â€“ Predictive modeling to identify potential cases of diabetes during pregnancy.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Statistical summaries, visualization, and feature correlations.
